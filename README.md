# Stock Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical stock market data to extract meaningful insights, visualize trends, and predict future stock prices. Using various data science techniques and machine learning models, it aims to assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of stock market datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations of stock trends and patterns
- Calculation of technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI)
- Machine Learning models including Neural Networks and XGBoost for price prediction
- Feature engineering to improve model accuracy
- Evaluation using metrics such as AUC, ROC, and confusion matrix

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ritika015/Stock-Market-Analysis.git
   cd Stock-Market-Analysis
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

* Open the Jupyter notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder to explore data analysis and model training.
* Run scripts or notebooks to preprocess data, train models, and generate visualizations.

## Results

* Achieved high accuracy in predicting stock price movements using XGBoost and Neural Networks.
* Identified key technical indicators influencing stock performance.
* Visualized stock trends and patterns for several companies.

## Future Work

* Integrate real-time stock price data for live predictions.
* Implement collaborative filtering for stock recommendation.
* Expand models to include additional financial indicators.
